The Amati relation and the Yonetoku relation are two good examples that enjoyed special attention. The former reflects the connection between the peak photon energy (Ep) and the isotropic $\\gamma$-ray energy release (Eiso), while the latter links Ep with the isotropic peak luminosity (Lp), both in the form of a power-law function. Most GRBs are found to follow these correlations well, but a theoretical interpretation is still lacking. Some obvious outliers may be off-axis GRBs and may follow correlations that are different from those at the on-axis. Here we present a simple analytical derivation for the Amati relation and the Yonetoku relation in the framework of the standard fireball model, the correctness of which is then confirmed by numerical simulations. The off-axis Amati relation and Yonetoku relation are also derived. They differ markedly from the corresponding on-axis relation. Our results reveal the intrinsic physics behind the radiation processes of GRBs, and they highlight the importance of the viewing angle in the empirical correlations of GRBs.
